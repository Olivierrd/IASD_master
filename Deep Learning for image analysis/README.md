<h1>Deep Learning for image analysis</h1>

This [course](https://github.com/criteo-research/master-iasd) has been teached by Criteo researchers. 

<h1>Project</h1>

The project was written in collaboration with Maxime Talarmain. 
The project_DL_image.py python file gathers all experiments. It is possible to reproduce all experiments using data availaible through the data link.
Besides the log folder helps to visualize all experiments using tensorboard. 

Expriments are divided in two parts.

It appears that we get best model using data preprocessing of the second part. We obtain 96.5% of accuracy on the model named MobileNet_AD_V2.
