# Deep Learning for image analysis

## Course

This [course](https://github.com/criteo-research/master-iasd) has been teached by Criteo researchers. 

Deep learning has achieved formidable results in the image analysis field in recent years, in many cases exceeding human performance. This success opens paths for new applications, entrepreneurship and research, while making the field very competitive. This course aims at providing the students with the theoretical and practical basis for understanding and using deep learning for image analysis applications. Program to be followed The course will be composed of lectures and practical sessions. Moreover, experts from industry will present practical applications of deep learning.

Lectures will include:

* Artificial neural networks, back-propagation algorithm
* Convolutional neural network
* Design and optimization of a neural architecture
* Successful architectures (AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet)
* Analysis of neural network function
* Image classification and segmentation
* Auto-encoders and generative networks
* Current research trends and perspectives During the practical sessions, the students will code in Python, using Keras and Tensorflow. They will be confronted with the practical problems linked to deep learning: architecture design; optimization schemes and hyper-parameter selection; analysis of results. Prerequisites: Linear algebra, basic probability and statistics


## Project

The project was written in collaboration with [Maxime Talarmain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxime-talarmain-58aa99165/?originalSubdomain=fr). 
The project_DL_image.py python file gathers all experiments. It is possible to reproduce all experiments using data availaible through the data link.
Besides the log folder helps to visualize all experiments using tensorboard. 

Expriments are divided in two parts.

It appears that we get best model using data preprocessing of the second part. We obtain 96.5% of accuracy on the model named MobileNet_AD_V2.
