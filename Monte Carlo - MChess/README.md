# Python Easy Chess GUI
A Chess GUI based from Python using PySimpleGUI and Python-Chess modules. Users can also load a chess engine and play with it. This program is based on a [demo chess against ai](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/Chess) from PySimpleGUI.<br>

We didn't implemented the game motor, neither the UI only the Monte Carlo IA.

The IA implemented are :
- UCB
- UCT
- RAVE (soon)
- GRAVE (soon)
- PUTC (soon)

The game motor and the UI was taken from : https://github.com/fsmosca/Python-Easy-Chess-GUI
