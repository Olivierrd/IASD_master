# Project Data Science 

# Course

The goal of this module is to provide students with a hands-on experience on a novel data-science/AI challenge using 
state-of-the-art tools and techniques discussed during other classes of this master. Students enrolled in this class 
will form groups and choose one topic among a list of proposed topics in the core areas of the master such as supervised
or unsupervised learning, recommendation, game AI, distributed or parallel data-science, etc. The topics will generally
consist in applying a well-established technique on a novel data-science challenge or in applying recent research 
results on a classical data-science challenge. Either way, each topic will come with its own novel scientific 
challenge to address. At the end of the module, the students will give an oral presentation to demonstrate their 
methodology and their findings. Strong scientific rigor as well as very good engineering and communication skills will 
be necessary to complete this module successfully.

# Projects 

This course focuses on projects in group of four-five students. 
My co-workers were Kenza Hammou, [Hadrien Mariaccia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hadrien-mar/) and 
[Amine El Iraki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amine-el-iraki-32296318a/).

The two projects are : 
* **Adversarial Attacks :** the goal is to try several adversarial attacks on CIFAR10 data and then try to do adversarial training
* **Transfer Learning :** trying to reproduce experimentation from a paper, present the paper and give a constructive criticism.

These projects were graded 13/20.
