## Project

The final exam was a project. Our team was composed by three students ([Louis Fontaine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisfontainepro/) 
and Kenza Hammou) and we have to create two projects :
* Covid19 project presents : "Le Covid19  comparable à d'autres épidémies, mais dont la propagation s'est faite
 rapidement à cause d'une politique différente entre les pays."
* Questionnaire's IASD proposes : an evaluation of the master by the students. As we are the first students to 
experience this program, this form helps to improve the master. The results remain confidential and therefore are not shared.

This work obtains the grade 17.5/20
