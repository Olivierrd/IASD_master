The IASD master is a master created in 2019 and deals with Artificial Intelligence, Systems and Data. 
I am proud to be part of the first master year. As master representative of year 2019-2020, I can say that this master 
is at the cutting edge of technology. This master is joined with PSL Master program between Paris-Dauphine, École 
normale supérieure, and Mines ParisTech
